# A Cosmology Calculator 

The purpose of the program is to provide some of the more commonly used cosmological parameters, as a function of redshift. The parameters provided are the comoving distance, $r$, the luminosity distance, $D_\mathrm{L}$, the angular diameter distance $D_\mathrm{A}$ and the age of the universe at redshift $z$, $t_\mathrm{age}$. 

If you're in astro, this will be a program you will almost certainly use at some point, if you're not in astro, it will at least be a simple program for you to use to learn python. 

Please see the Cosmology.pdf file for a detailed explanation of the physics and the code.
